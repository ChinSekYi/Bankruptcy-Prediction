This project will explore and compare the usage of different machine learning models to predict company bankruptcy. We will evaluate the different models using various metrics, 
and improve its accuracy for better model performance. We will also use custom functions which will work well on our specific dataset. 
The dataset is about bankruptcy prediction of Polish companies. The bankrupt companies were analyzed in the period 2000-2012, while the still operating companies were evaluated from 2007 to 2013. 
The dataset consists of 64 features that pertain to various financial ratios and performance metrics that encompass aspects such as profitability, liquidity, solvency, and operational efficiency of a company.
