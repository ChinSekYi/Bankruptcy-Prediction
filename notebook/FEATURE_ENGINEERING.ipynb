    "It involves transforming raw data into **meaningful representations** that make patterns easier for algorithms to detect.   \n",

    "It focuses on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creating new features from raw data.\n",
    "- Transforming features to capture patterns better (e.g., scaling, encoding, creating interaction terms, or extracting time-based features).\n",
    "- Adding domain knowledge to enhance the input data's relevance for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering is a creative and manual process that helps extract more useful information from the data."
