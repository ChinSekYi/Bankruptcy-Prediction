    "### Project Motivation\n",
    "In today's dynamic business landscape, exemplified by recent events such as the bankruptcy of Silicon Valley Bank, the ability to anticipate and mitigate financial risks is crucial for sustainable growth and stability. This project aims to develop a robust predictive model of company bankruptcy, leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and financial data analysis techniques, so as to equip stakeholders with nuanced insights to confidently traverse the unpredictable landscape of financial risk."

    "### Dataset Description\n",
    "The dataset used in this project is about bankruptcy prediction of Polish companies. The data was collected from [Emerging Markets Information Service](http://www.securities.com), which is a database containing information on emerging markets around the world. The bankrupt companies were analyzed in the period 2000-2012, while the still operating companies were evaluated from 2007 to 2013.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Basing on the collected data five classification cases were distinguished, that depends on the forecasting period:\n",
    "- 1stYear â€“ the data contains financial rates from 1st year of the forecasting period and corresponding class label that indicates bankruptcy status after 5 years. The data contains 7027 instances (financial statements), 271 represents bankrupted companies, 6756 firms that did not bankrupt in the forecasting period.\n",
    "- 2ndYear â€“ the data contains financial rates from 2nd year of the forecasting period and corresponding class label that indicates bankruptcy status after 4 years. The data contains 10173 instances (financial statements), 400 represents bankrupted companies, 9773 firms that did not bankrupt in the forecasting period.\n",
    "- 3rdYear â€“ the data contains financial rates from 3rd year of the forecasting period and corresponding class label that indicates bankruptcy status after 3 years. The data contains 10503 instances (financial statements), 495 represents bankrupted companies, 10008 firms that did not bankrupt in the forecasting period.\n",
    "- 4thYear â€“ the data contains financial rates from 4th year of the forecasting period and corresponding class label that indicates bankruptcy status after 2 years. The data contains 9792 instances (financial statements), 515 represents bankrupted companies, 9277 firms that did not bankrupt in the forecasting period.\n",
    "- 5thYear â€“ the data contains financial rates from 5th year of the forecasting period and corresponding class label that indicates bankruptcy status after 1 year. The data contains 5910 instances (financial statements), 410 represents bankrupted companies, 5500 firms that did not bankrupt in the forecasting period.\n",

    "### Proposed solution\n",
    "The proposed solution involves employing a diverse array of predictive models, including logistic regression, k nearest neighbors and decision trees, each tailored to identify companies at risk of bankruptcy. To gauge effectiveness, logistic regression will serve as the benchmark classifier, ensuring a thorough evaluation of alternative models. We will also leverage ensemble methods including bagging, boosting and random forests to amplify our model's predictive capabilities, while enriching our understanding of machine learning techniques."
