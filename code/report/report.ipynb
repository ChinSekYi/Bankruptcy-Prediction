    "### 1.3 Methodologies <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"section1_3\"></a>\n",
    "This project is structured into five distinct steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**: This initial phase involves setting up a web scraper to automate the acquisition and transformation of the desired dataset. The process is designed to systematically download and convert data, streamlining subsequent analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In this step, various visualization tools such as histograms and heatmaps are employed to explore the data distribution and examine the relationships between features. This analysis helps identify patterns and insights that inform further data handling strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Pre-processing**: During this stage, missing values are addressed through mean imputation, ensuring no data is unnecessarily discarded. Additionally, numerical values are standardized to neutralize disparities in scale among features, enhancing model accuracy. To mitigate the effects of multicollinearity, features that show high correlation with others are selectively removed. As the dataset is highly imbalanced, we used Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to generate instances of the minortity class for training. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Modeling**: Various well-established machine learning algorithms are utilized in this step, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Trees, to develop predictive models for predicting company bankruptcy. Logistic regression serves as a baseline for comparison. Advanced techniques such as bagging and boosting are implemented to improve each model's robustness. Furthermore, the potential of neural networks is explored to assess their efficacy in enhancing predictive performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Evaluation and Comparison**: The final step involves a thorough evaluation and comparison of each model's performance. The outcomes are meticulously analyzed to identify the most effective model, which is then detailed in this section, highlighting the relative advantages and effectiveness of the approaches used.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured approach ensures a comprehensive analysis and robust development of predictive models, aiming to deliver reliable and actionable insights."
